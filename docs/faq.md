# Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I register my company in the Portal?

Currently, access to the Portal is invite-only.

### I was registered for AEC (CERT.at/GovCERT), but my credentials work for CERT.at (GovCERT/AEC). Is it alright?

Yes, everything is correct. Tuency support multiple tenants and ensure the correct privileges entirely
on the server side. The domain you use to access CP changes only the theme, not the functionality.
Regardless of the Portal "skin" you use, you have always the same privileges and access to the same
data.

### I was using the legacy Constituency Portal. What happens with it and my previous data?

We have migrated data from the old Constituency Portal to Tuency (the new Portal). The old portal will
be accessible until we move all integrations to the new one, but we as __not__ to edit data in the
legacy Portal unless we explicitly ask you to do so. After the initial migration, we do not synchronize them.
