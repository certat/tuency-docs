# Welcome to Constituency Portal

This documentation aims to guide users over the Constituency Portal for CERT.at, AEC and GovCERT.
We do our bests to refer to the current state of the Portal, but we cannot guarantee that the
documentation covers all aspects. We welcome contributions through our public
 [Github repository](https://github.com/certat/tuency-docs).

## Role of the Portal

Constituency Portal is designed primarily as the central, self-governed contact and network assets
database. We welcome verified organizations to manage their contact data we can use in case of
security incidents or notifications. New Constituency Portal replaces the legacy Portal
provided in the past.

## Supported features

We're slowly extending features available in the Constituency Portal. Currently, we encourage
using only the **Contacts** tab. Networking assets and notification rules are not integrated
with our systems yet.

## Feedback

Constituency Portal is built using open-source software [Tuency](https://gitlab.com/intevation/tuency/tuency),
and we develop it further, ensuring it matches the needs of our constituency. We're thrilled to hear
your feedback! Use our public [contact channels](https://cert.at/en/about-us/contact/)
or pass it through your direct contact with CERT.at.

Tuency was originally partially founded by the CEF Framework.
