# Welcome to the Constituency Portal

This documentation is designed to help users navigate the Constituency Portal for CERT.at, AEC,
and GovCERT. While we strive to keep this documentation up-to-date, please be aware that it may
not cover all features and functionalities. Your contributions are welcome
via our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/certat/constituency-docs).

## Purpose of the Portal

The Constituency Portal serves as a centralized, self-managed database for contact and network
assets. It allows verified organizations to manage their contact information, which is vital for
communicating during security incidents or notifications. This portal replaces the previous Portal.

## Current Features

The Constituency Portal is undergoing continuous improvement, and we are gradually expanding its
features. At present, we recommend using the **Contacts** tab, as integration for networking assets
and notification rules with our systems is still in progress.

## Accessing the Portal

You can access the Constituency Portal for different sectors through the following links:

## Feedback and Contributions

The Constituency Portal is developed as an open-source project using the [Tuency](https://gitlab.com/intevation/tuency/tuency)
software. We are keen to adapt the portal to better meet the needs of our users and welcome your
feedback. Please use our public [contact channels](https://cert.at/en/about-us/contact/) or get in
touch directly with CERT.at.

The development of Tuency was initially supported by the CEF Framework.
