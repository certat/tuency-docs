# Welcome to the Constituency Portal

This documentation is designed to help users navigate the Constituency Portal for CERT.at, AEC,
and GovCERT. While we strive to keep this documentation up-to-date, please be aware that it may
not cover all features and functionalities. Your contributions are welcome
via our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/certat/tuency-docs).

## Purpose of the Portal

The Constituency Portal serves as a centralized, self-managed database for contact and network
assets. It allows verified organisations to manage their contact information, which is vital for
communicating during security incidents or notifications.

## Current Features

The Constituency Portal is undergoing continuous improvement, and we are gradually expanding its
features. At present, we recommend using the **Contacts** tab, as integration for networking assets
and notification rules with our systems is still in progress.

## Accessing the Portal

You can access the Constituency Portal for different sectors through the following links:

## Feedback and Contributions

The Constituency Portal is developed as an open-source project using the [Tuency](https://gitlab.com/intevation/tuency/tuency)
software. We are keen to adapt the portal to better meet the needs of our users and welcome your
feedback. Please use our public [contact channels](https://cert.at/en/about-us/contact/) or get in
touch directly with CERT.at.

The development of Tuency was initially supported by the CEF Framework.
