# Managing Your Organization

This section provides guidance for organization administrators using the Constituency Portal.
As a self-management tool, Tuency empowers you to handle various aspects of your organization:

1. Manage all contact information.
2. Add and remove other organization administrators (orgadmins).
3. Create suborganizations.

Future updates will include the management of network objects and notification rules, which are
currently not available.
