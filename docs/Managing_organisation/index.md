# Managing Your Organisation

This section provides guidance for organisation administrators using the Constituency Portal.
As a self-management tool, Tuency empowers you to handle various aspects of your organisation:

1. Manage all contact information.
2. Add and remove other organisation administrators (orgadmins).
3. Create suborganisations.

Future updates will include the management of network objects and notification rules, which are
currently not available.
