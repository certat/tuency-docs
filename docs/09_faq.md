# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How can I register my company in the Portal?

Registration to the Portal is currently by invitation only.

## I registered for AEC (CERT.at/GovCERT), but my credentials also work for CERT.at (GovCERT/AEC). Is this correct?

Yes, this is expected behavior. Tuency supports multiple tenants and manages the correct privileges
on the server side. The domain you use to access the Constituency Portal only affects the
visual theme, not the functionality. Regardless of the "skin" you use, your privileges and access
to data remain the same.

## What will happen to the legacy Constituency Portal and my data there?

We have migrated all data from the old Constituency Portal to Tuency, the new portal. The legacy
portal will remain accessible until all integrations are moved to the new system. However, we
request that you __do not__ make any edits to data in the legacy portal unless specifically
instructed by us. Data synchronization between the two systems will not occur after the initial
migration.

## Why do some contacts look like duplicates?

The old portal and Tuency use different approaches to store and validate data. Because of this,
it wasn't always possible to migrate without losing any information and without manually checking
each contact. If a user had different contact information for different roles in the old portal
it was migrated as different contact records. Sometimes this could be due to typos, different phone
phone numbers, or different email addresses. If you believe that some contacts shouldn't be
duplicated, we recommend saving the current data in one and removing the second.

We're also looking into improvements to the contact form, such as allowing more than one email address.
