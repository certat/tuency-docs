# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How can I register my company in the Portal?

Registration to the Portal is currently by invitation only.

## I registered for AEC (CERT.at/GovCERT), but my credentials also work for CERT.at (GovCERT/AEC). Is this correct?

Yes, this is expected behavior. Tuency supports multiple tenants and manages the correct privileges
on the server side. The domain you use to access the Constituency Portal only affects the
visual theme, not the functionality. Regardless of the "skin" you use, your privileges and access
to data remain the same.

## What will happen to the legacy Constituency Portal and my data there?

We have migrated all data from the old Constituency Portal to Tuency, the new portal. The legacy
portal will remain accessible until all integrations are moved to the new system. However, we
request that you __do not__ make any edits to data in the legacy portal unless specifically
instructed by us. Data synchronization between the two systems will not occur after the initial
migration.
