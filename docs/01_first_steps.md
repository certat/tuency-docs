# First Steps

## Registration

You will receive an invitation email. Follow the link to set up your account. During this process,
you will be asked to create a password and set up a Multi-Factor Authentication app, along
with backup recovery codes. After completing the setup, you can log in to the Portal and access
your organisation's information.

Your password must meet the following criteria:

1. A minimum length of 16 characters.
2. At least one uppercase and one lowercase letter.
3. At least one digit and one special character.

You can later add physical keys as an MFA method in the [account management section](03_account.md#configuring-mfa-apps-and-devices).

!!! note

    The invitation email is valid for 72 hours. If it expires, you will need to request a new
    invitation from CERT.at.

of the dashboard serve various purposes:

   depending on your role.
3. _organisations_ for managing organisations related to your role.

5. _Add Colleague_ to invite coworkers to help manage your organisation.
6. _Switch Node_ appears if you have roles in more than one organisation and allows switching
   between contexts.
7. A note indicating your privilege level in the current context.
8. _Profile_ for [managing your account](03_account.md), including password changes.
