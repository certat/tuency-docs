# Tuency Documentation

This repository keeps documentation for the Constituency Portal provided by CERT.at. We welcome
any contribution improving the documentation.

The software powering portal is [Tuency](https://gitlab.com/intevation/tuency/tuency), so many parts
can also be useful for other deployments.

Please note, this repository is not automatically deployed to our servers and acts as development
version. If you're looking for current official documentation, please check https://tuency.cert.at/docs/


## License note

While the documentation text is open-sourced, our logo is not and we do not allow using it without
permission. If you plan to re-use the documentation or its parts, please ensure removing our branding.
